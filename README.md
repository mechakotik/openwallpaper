OpenWallpaper is a powerful open source platform for interactive live wallpapers. In OpenWallpaper, a scene is a WebAssembly module that does rendering to screen and other platform-dependent stuff using standardized host-implemented API. This gives a next level of freedom to scene creators, while being simple and easily portable to many platforms.

You can learn more about the project at [openwallpaper.org](https://openwallpaper.org). Here you can find info on how to build and run wallpaperd and wpe-compile, developer guide, scene examples and API reference. Enjoy!
